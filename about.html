  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm 21 years old, computer science student, software developer, security enthusiast, and tech geek.
    My journey started in 2012 when mom prepared me a surprise. She bought me a PC.
    I wish I could have one before, but our modest life did not allow it.

    Through my high school, I learned a lot about design tools, principles, and techniques on my computer.
    Iâ€™ve had a long shot in graphic design, taking independent courses, and almost be a senior.
    But in the last year of high school, I felt it was not my passion. I just felt that I learned all of this to understand the computer world.
    I thought if I were the one who could understand how the computer works, I would have made the biggest change in my life.
    So, I learned about web design in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>.

    In my last year, my math teacher taught me the rigorous thinking of math and statistics.
    I enjoyed solving mathematical puzzles, so I wondered why not study computer science and its mathematics?
    This area of science can show me the core of computer hardware, principles of programming, algorithms, computational theory, concurrent systems, networking, and artificial intelligence.
    It also can teach me how a modern computer works. I felt that it was the true calling that can change my life and direct my aims.
